# Documentation of Work:

## Onboarding

The onboarding was pretty straight forward. The project's README included an easily accessible URL to "Setting Up" instructions, and elaborate documentation on an external website. The repository also contained all documentation in a directory: `docs`. The project's dependencies required some of us to downgrade our Java version, however, the instructions to configure the project accordingly were clearly described in the documentation.

The building process was run by first executing `./gradlew createConfigs`, then `gradle build`, which automatically installed the necessary components, without errors. If one wanted to install dependencies for front-end development, the steps for that were also clearly described in the documentation.

Back-end tests were run by executing `./gradlew componentTests`. Thanks to _gradle_ all component tests were run automatically, and when 635 tests had been run the testing was manually stopped. Of all tests, only 7 failed. Examples are failures that occurred due to lack of third-party dependencies (email services), and/or date/time tests that failed because they were run on a Swedish OS. 

In conclusion, the onboarding experience was smooth and we plan to continue with the project.


## Part 1: Complexity Measurement
We used `lizard` to inspect the complexity of the repository. The results were collected to google [sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pyIgCouwoHa9f4Q0DBhj_9gXWa7iI7MTI_X0eoj8KbU/edit#gid=1684196533). From the analyzed methods, the following ten methods were deemed sufficiently complex:

|# | Cyclomatic Complexity | LOC | Method                                                                           |
|--|-----------------------|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1 |                    21 |  40 | BasicFeedbackSubmissionAction::getRecipientSection                               |
|2 |                    19 |  76 | FeedbackSessionsDb::updateFeedbackSession                                        |
|3 |                    19 |  60 | FeedbackResponsesLogic::isFeedbackParticipantNameVisibleToUser                   |
|4 |                    18 |  59 | FeedbackMcqQuestionDetails::validateQuestionDetails                              |
|5 |                    17 |  88 | GetFeedbackSessionLogsAction::execute                                            |
|6 |                    17 |  68 | SessionResultsData::buildSingleResponseForStudent                                |
|7 |                    17 |  52 | FeedbackResponseCommentsLogic::isFeedbackParticipantNameVisibleToUser            |
|8 |                    16 |  82 | FeedbackRankRecipientsResponseDetails::getUpdateOptionsForRankRecipientQuestions |
|9 |                    15 |  50 | SessionResultsData::initForStudent                                               |
|10|                    15 |  41 | FeedbackMsqQuestionDetails::shouldChangesRequireResponseDeletion                 |

Out of these, the following five methods were chosen for manual complexity calculation:

|                    15 |  50 | SessionResultsData::initForStudent                                               | Edvin: 15, Samuel: 16        |
