# Complexity analysis

### Questions answered for the 10 selected high complexity functions
1. What are your results? Did everyone get the same result? Is there something that is unclear? If you have a tool, is its result the same as yours?
2. Are the functions/methods with high CC also very long in terms of LOC?
3. What is the purpose of these functions? Is it related to the high CC? 
4. If your programming language uses exceptions: 

- Are they taken into account by the tool? 
- If you think of an exception as another possible branch (to the catch block or the end of the function), how is the CC affected? 

5. Is the documentation of the function clear about the different possible outcomes induced by different branches taken?

### Function 3: `FeedbackResponsesLogic::isFeedbackParticipantNameVisibleToUser`
1. This function's complexity was not one of the functions calculated by hand.
2. The function has 60 LOC which I consider to be too long. There is a lot of exit points in the function that reduces the CC. The functions almost exclusively consists of if, else, case, switch, return, break.
3. As given in the name, itâ€™s a function that checks if the participant receiving the feedback is visible to the user.  Without have used the software, I assume there is a high complexity if things should be visible or not because of privacy and integrity.
4. There are no exceptions. However, the function includes assertions that seem to be included in the count performed by lizard.
5. There is none documentation of the function and the different outcomes.
